## Usage Guidelines

1. **Add to all new files**: Every new source file should include an appropriate copyright header
2. **Place at the top**: Headers should be the first thing in the file (after shebang if applicable)
3. **Adapt format**: Use the comment style appropriate for the file type
4. **Keep consistent**: Use the same year and format across all files
5. **Update year**: When making substantial modifications, update the year if appropriate
